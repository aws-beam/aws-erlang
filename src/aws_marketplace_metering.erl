%% @doc AWS Marketplace Metering Service
%%
%% This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace
%% Metering Service API.
%%
%% AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom
%% usage dimensions.
%%
%% For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS
%% Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions in the AWS Marketplace
%% Seller Guide.
%%
%% Submitting Metering Records
%%
%% <ul> <li> MeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace
%% product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running
%% on EKS or ECS.
%%
%% </li> <li> BatchMeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a set of
%% customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
%% application.
%%
%% </li> </ul> Accepting New Customers
%%
%% <ul> <li> ResolveCustomer- Called by a SaaS application during the
%% registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the
%% registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the
%% browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a
%% CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
%%
%% </li> </ul> Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products
%%
%% <ul> <li> Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace
%% must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
%% RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and
%% BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call
%% RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your
%% seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation,
%% see Container-Based Products.
%%
%% </li> </ul> BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You
%% can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent
%% are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of
%% BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time.
%% For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .

%% API
%%====================================================================

%% @doc BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS
%% Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.
%%
%% For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried
%% with the same records or a subset of the input records.
%%
%% Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter
%% usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to
%% BatchMeterUsage.
%%
%% BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
%%
%% A UsageRecord can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to
%% provide customers with usagedata split into buckets by tags that you
%% define (or allow the customer to define).
%%
%% BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.

%% @doc API to emit metering records.
%%
%% For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It simply returns the
%% metering record ID.
%%
%% MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer's AWS account using credentials
%% from the EC2 instance, ECS task, or EKS pod.
%%
%% MeterUsage can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide
%% customers with usage data split into buckets by tags that you define (or
%% allow the customer to define).

%% @doc Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
%% integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
%% RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering.
%%
%% Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to
%% call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to
%% receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the
%% behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions:
%% metering and entitlement.
%%
%% <ul> <li> Entitlement: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the
%% customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS
%% Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your
%% container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to
%% guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
%% CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be
%% thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the
%% same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not
%% throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes
%% while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.
%%
%% </li> <li> Metering: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per
%% hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A
%% minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For
%% example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and
%% a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will
%% launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged:
%% (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by
%% the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your software is not
%% required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call
%% RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS
%% Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers
%% for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers
%% subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform
%% entitlement checks at runtime.
