%% @doc AWS Health
%%
%% The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
%% information that appears in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.
%%
%% You can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events
%% that affect your AWS services and resources.
%%
%% You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support to
%% use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account
%% that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a
%% `SubscriptionRequiredException' error.
%%
%% AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS).
%% Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations.
%%
%% For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4
%% Signing Process.
%%
%% If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS
%% Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized
%% view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You
%% can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your
%% organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of
%% security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to
%% enable this feature and return event information. For more information,
%% see Aggregating AWS Health events in the AWS Health User Guide.
%%
%% When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events,
%% see the following recommendations:
%%
%% Use the eventScopeCode parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health
%% events that are public or account-specific.
%%
%% Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you
%% call the `DescribeEventsForOrganization' operation to get all events in
%% your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
%% `nextToken' in the next request to return more results.
