%%
%% <ul> <li> The Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward

%%
%% You can also call this operation for assignments that were previous

%% @doc The `CreateHIT' operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task
%% (HIT).
%%
%% The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon
%% Mechanical Turk website.
%%
%% This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for
%% the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of
%% assignments. When you pass these values to `CreateHIT', a new HIT is
%% created for you, with a new `HITTypeID'. The HITTypeID can be used to
%% create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common
%% parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.
%%
%% An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using
%% the `CreateHITType' operation and then call the `CreateHITWithHITType'
%% operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are
%% creating large numbers of HITs.
%%
%% CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by
%% providing a value for the `Question' parameter that fully specifies the
%% contents of the HIT, or by providing a `HitLayoutId' and associated
%% `HitLayoutParameters'.
%%
%% If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an
%% additional fee. For more information, see Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing.

%% assignments), or on a HIT that is Reviewable but without all of its
%% submitted assignments already approved or rejected, the service will
%% return an error.
%%
%% HITs are automatically disposed of after 120 days.
%%
%% After you dispose of a HIT, you can no longer approve the HIT's rejected
%% assignments.

%% @doc The `SendBonus' operation issues a payment of money from your account
%% to a Worker.
%%
%% This payment happens separately from the reward you pay to the Worker when
%% you approve the Worker's assignment. The SendBonus operation requires the
%% Worker's ID and the assignment ID as parameters to initiate payment of the
%% bonus. You must include a message that explains the reason for the bonus
%% payment, as the Worker may not be expecting the payment. Amazon Mechanical
%% Turk collects a fee for bonus payments, similar to the HIT listing fee.
%% This operation fails if your account does not have enough funds to pay for
%% both the bonus and the fees.

%% specification with a new one. You can call the UpdateNotificationSettings
%% operation to enable or disable notifications for the HIT type, without
%% having to modify the notification specification itself by providing
%% updates to the Active status without specifying a new notification
%% specification. To change the Active status of a HIT type's notifications,
%% the HIT type must already have a notification specification, or one must
%% be provided in the same call to `UpdateNotificationSettings'.

%% @doc The `UpdateQualificationType' operation modifies the attributes of an
%% existing Qualification type, which is represented by a QualificationType
%% data structure.
%%
%% Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its attributes.
%%
%% Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after the type has
%% been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified.
%% The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the
%% delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to
%% disable retries.
%%
%% You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type.
%% The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test,
%% TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters
%% specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you
%% must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey
%% parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does
%% not have an answer key.
%%
%% If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is
%% unchanged. There is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type that
%% has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be
%% AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is
%% provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test.
%%
%% If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test
%% without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the
%% original questions, along with the updated values.
%%
%% If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not
%% have an answer key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted
%% manually.
%%
%% You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the
%% Qualification type.
