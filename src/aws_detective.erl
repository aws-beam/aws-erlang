%% @doc Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to
%% help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
%% Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads.
%%
%% Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts,
%% API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private
%% Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon
%% GuardDuty.
%%
%% The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of
%% behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set
%% of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator
%% account.
%%
%% To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account
%% sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the
%% invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.
%%
%% Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
%% management account designates the Detective administrator account for the
%% organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the
%% organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account can
%% enable any organization account as a member account in the organization
%% behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The
%% Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to the
%% organization behavior graph.
%%
%% Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to
%% manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with
%% the currently selected endpoint.
%%
%% The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API
%% to do the following:
%%
%% <ul> <li> Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
%% behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> Apply tags to a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> </ul> The organization management account can use the Detective API
%% to select the delegated administrator for Detective.
%%
%% The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the
%% Detective API to do the following:
%%
%% <ul> <li> Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
%%
%% </li> <li> Determine whether to automatically enable new organization
%% accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> </ul> An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the
%% following:
%%
%% <ul> <li> View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
%%
%% </li> <li> Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> <li> Remove their account from a behavior graph.
%%
%% </li> </ul> All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging
%% Detective API Calls with CloudTrail.
%%
%% We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator
%% account." An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple
%% accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the
%% accounts in their behavior graph.

%% @doc `CreateMembers' is used to send invitations to accounts.

%% uses `CreateMembers' to enable organization accounts as member accounts.

%% specified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the
%% behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator
%% account for a behavior graph.
%%
%% `CreateMembers' verifies the accounts and then invites the verified
%% accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation
%% emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator
%% manages their member accounts centrally.

%% For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,
%% `CreateMembers' attempts to enable the accounts. The organization accounts
%% do not receive invitations.

%% The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to

%%
%% <ul> <li> The accounts that `CreateMembers' was able to process. For
%% invited accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that
%% have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed
