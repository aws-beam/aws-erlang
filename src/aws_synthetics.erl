%%
%% You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your
%% services.
%%
%% You can create and manage canaries, which are modular, lightweight scripts
%% that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up
%% your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help
%% you check the availability and latency of your web services and
%% troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the
%% UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch
%% ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your
%% applications. For more information, see Using ServiceLens to Monitor the
%% Health of Your Applications in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
%%
%% Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security
%% considerations. For more information, see Security Considerations for
%% Synthetics Canaries.

%% API
%%====================================================================

%% @doc Creates a canary.
%%
%% Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the
%% outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your
%% web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data,
%% screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run
%% continuously or just once.
%%
%% Do not use `CreateCanary' to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary
%% instead.
%%
%% To create canaries, you must have the `CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess'
%% policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need
%% the the `iam:CreateRole', `iam:CreatePolicy' and `iam:AttachRolePolicy'
%% permissions. For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions.
%%
%% Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names.
%% The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
%% canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For
%% more information, see Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries.

%% @doc Permanently deletes the specified canary.
%%
%% When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are not
%% automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to
%% use again, you should also delete the following:
%%
%% <ul> <li> The Lambda functions and layers used by this canary. These have
%% the prefix `cwsyn-MyCanaryName '.
%%
%% </li> <li> The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms
%% have a name of `Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-MyCanaryName '.
%%
%% </li> <li> Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's artifact
%% location.
%%
%% </li> <li> IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the
%% console, these roles have the name `
%% role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-MyCanaryName '.
%%
%% </li> <li> CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs
%% groups have the name `/aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName '.
%%
%% </li> </ul> Before you delete a canary, you might want to use `GetCanary'
%% to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information
%% returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after
%% you delete the canary.
