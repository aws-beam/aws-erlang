%% @doc Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security
%% state of your AWS environment and resources.
%%
%% It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based
%% on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects
%% security data from AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party
%% products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to
%% identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about
%% Security Hub, see the AWS Security Hub User Guide .
%%
%% When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed
%% only in the AWS Region that is currently active or in the specific AWS
%% Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings
%% change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To
%% make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for each
%% Region to apply the change to.
%%
%% For example, if your Region is set to `us-west-2', when you use `
%% `CreateMembers' ' to add a member account to Security Hub, the association
%% of the member account with the master account is created only in the
%% `us-west-2' Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in
%% the same Region that the invitation was sent from.
%%
%% The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API
%% operations.
%%
%% <ul> <li> ` `BatchEnableStandards' ' - `RateLimit' of 1 request per
%% second, `BurstLimit' of 1 request per second.
%%
%% </li> <li> ` `GetFindings' ' - `RateLimit' of 3 requests per second.
%% `BurstLimit' of 6 requests per second.
%%
%% </li> <li> ` `UpdateFindings' ' - `RateLimit' of 1 request per second.
%% `BurstLimit' of 5 requests per second.
%%
%% </li> <li> ` `UpdateStandardsControl' ' - `RateLimit' of 1 request per
%% second, `BurstLimit' of 5 requests per second.
%%
%% </li> <li> All other operations - `RateLimit' of 10 requests per second.
%% `BurstLimit' of 30 requests per second.
%%
%% </li> </ul>
