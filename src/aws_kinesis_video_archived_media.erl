%% @doc Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for

%%
%% An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
%% providing data through MPEG-DASH:
%%
%% <ul> <li> The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and,
%% optionally, AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of
%% track 1 should be `V_MPEG/ISO/AVC' (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for
%% H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be `A_AAC' (for AAC) or
%% A_MS/ACM (for G.711).
%%
%% </li> <li> Data retention must be greater than 0.
%%
%% </li> <li> The video track of each fragment must contain codec private
%% data in the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for
%% H.265 format. For more information, see MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
%% 14496-15. For information about adapting stream data to a given format,
%% see NAL Adaptation Flags.
%%
%% </li> <li> The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain
%% codec private data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7)
%% or the MS Wave format.
%%
%% </li> </ul> The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with
%% Kinesis Video Streams:
%%
%% <ol> <li> Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint, specifying
%% `GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL' for the `APIName' parameter.
%%
%% </li> <li> Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using `GetDASHStreamingSessionURL'.
%% Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be used
%% for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
%% `GetDASHStreamingSessionURL' returns an authenticated URL (that includes
%% an encrypted session token) for the session's MPEG-DASH manifest (the root
%% resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).
%%
%% Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access
%% it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the
%% token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.
%%
%% The media that is made available through the manifest consists only of the
%% requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as
%% frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made
%% available.
%%
%% </li> <li> Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for
%% the MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH
%% protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment and
%% media fragments available through the manifest URL. The initialization
%% fragment contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data
%% needed to set up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The media
%% fragments contain encoded video frames or encoded audio samples.
%%
%% </li> <li> The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests
%% stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
%% data, it calls the following actions:
%%
%% <ul> <li> GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which contains
%% the metadata for the media that you want to playback.
%%
%% </li> <li> GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment.
%% The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before
%% loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "`fytp'" and
%% "`moov'" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the
%% media player decoder.
%%
%% The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis
%% video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the stream and
%% respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media frames.
%%
%% </li> <li> GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
%% fragments contain the "`moof'" and "`mdat'" MP4 atoms and their child
%% atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media frames and their
%% timestamps.
%%
%% After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session,
%% any fragments that don't contain the same codec private data cause an
%% error to be returned when those different media fragments are loaded.
%% Therefore, the codec private data should not change between fragments in a
%% session. This also means that the session fails if the fragments in a
%% stream change from having only video to having both audio and video.
%%
%% Data retrieved with this action is billable. See Pricing for details.
%%
%% </li> </ul> </li> </ol> The following restrictions apply to MPEG-DASH
%% sessions:
%%
%% A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service
%% might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For
%% connection limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.
%%
%% A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active MPEG-DASH
%% streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of
%% sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is
%% closed. The number of active `GetMedia' connections on a Kinesis video
%% stream does not count against this limit, and the number of active
%% MPEG-DASH sessions does not count against the active `GetMedia' connection
%% limit.
%%
%% The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions are
%% independent of each other.
%%
%% You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
%% monitoring the `GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes' Amazon CloudWatch
%% metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
%% Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams. For pricing information,
%% see Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing and AWS Pricing. Charges for both
%% HLS sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.
%%
%% For more information about HLS, see HTTP Live Streaming on the Apple
%% Developer site.
%%
%% If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
%% media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
%% includes the following pieces of information:
%%
%% `x-amz-ErrorType' HTTP header – contains a more specific error type in
%% addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
%%
%% `x-amz-RequestId' HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to AWS, the
%% support team can better diagnose the problem if given the Request Id.
%%
%% Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make
%% programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and under what
%% conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client
%% programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again.

%% called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
%% information about HLS fragment types, see the HLS specification.
%%
%% The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
%%
%% <ol> <li> Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint, specifying

%%
%% </li> <li> Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for

%% Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization
%% fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist URL.
%% The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the

%% AAC-encoded audio samples.
%%
%% </li> <li> The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests
%% stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
%% data, it calls the following actions:
%%
%% <ul> <li> GetHLSMasterPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which
%% contains a URL for the `GetHLSMediaPlaylist' action for each track, and
%% additional metadata for the media player, including estimated bitrate and
%% resolution.
%%
%% </li> <li> GetHLSMediaPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
%% contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with the
%% `GetMP4InitFragment' action, and URLs to access the MP4 media fragments
%% with the `GetMP4MediaFragment' actions. The HLS media playlist also
%% contains metadata about the stream that the player needs to play it, such
%% as whether the `PlaybackMode' is `LIVE' or `ON_DEMAND'. The HLS media
%% playlist is typically static for sessions with a `PlaybackType' of
%% `ON_DEMAND'. The HLS media playlist is continually updated with new
%% fragments for sessions with a `PlaybackType' of `LIVE'. There is a
%% distinct HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if
%% applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.
%%
%% </li> <li> GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment.
%% The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before
