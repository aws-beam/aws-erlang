%% @doc This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions.
%%
%% For each user session, you pass in an `entityID' that represents the user.
%% Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation.
%%
%% The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the user's
%% `entityID' matches an override rule, the user is served the variation
%% specified by that rule.
%%
%% Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a
%% variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of
%% users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the
%% launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the
%% various feature variations used for the launch.
%%
%% If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing
%% experiment for this feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in
%% the experiment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that
%% are allocated to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the
%% experiment, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the
%% various feature variations used for the experiment.
%%
%% If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the
%% default variation.
