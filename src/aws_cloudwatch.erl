%% @doc Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources

%%
%% You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the
%% variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.
%%
%% CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources
%% you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can
%% monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
%% instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
%% additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data
%% to stop under-used instances to save money.
%%
%% In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can
%% monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
%% visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
%% operational health.

%% @doc Deletes the specified alarms.
%%
%% You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can
%% include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99
%% metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't
%% delete two composite alarms with one operation.
%%
%% In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.
%%
%% It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
%% composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also
%% depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any
%% composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a
%% composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.
%%
%% To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the
%% rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency
%% that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to
%% change the `AlarmRule' of one of the alarms to `False'.
%%
%% Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
%% detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

%% @doc Gets statistics for the specified metric.
%%
%% The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If
%% you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To
%% reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range
%% and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can
%% increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in
%% chronological order.
%%
%% CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that
%% you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour
%% period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall
%% within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by
%% CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.
%%
%% CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If
%% you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve
%% percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is
%% true:
%%
%% <ul> <li> The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.
%%
%% </li> <li> The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

%% @doc Creates or updates a composite alarm.
%%
%% When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the
%% alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you
%% have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all
%% conditions of the rule are met.
%%
%% The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include
%% metric alarms and other composite alarms.
%%
%% Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple
%% metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only
%% for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm
%% that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying
%% metric alarms are in ALARM state.
%%
%% Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms
%% are notifying SNS topics.
%%
%% It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
%% composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also
%% depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any
%% composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a
%% composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.
%%
%% To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the
%% rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency
%% that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to
%% change the `AlarmRule' of one of the alarms to `False'.
%%
%% Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
%% detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
%%
%% When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
%% to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA'. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
%% appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then
%% executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the
%% only time that the alarm can be in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA' state.
%%
%% When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
%% update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

%% @doc Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified
%% metric, metric math expression, or anomaly detection model.
%%
%% Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions.
%%
%% When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
%% to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA'. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
%% appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then
%% executed.
%%
%% When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
%% update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
%%
%% If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some
%% alarm operations:
%%
%% <ul> <li> `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole' for all alarms with EC2 actions
%%
%% </li> <li> `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus' and `ec2:DescribeInstances' for
%% all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics
%%
%% </li> <li> `ec2:StopInstances' for alarms with stop actions
%%
%% </li> <li> `ec2:TerminateInstances' for alarms with terminate actions
%%
%% </li> <li> No specific permissions are needed for alarms with recover
%% actions
%%
%% </li> </ul> If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but
%% not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm, but the stop or
%% terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted the
%% required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are
%% performed.
%%
%% If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you
%% cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you
%% can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon
%% SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.
%%
%% If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you
%% cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.
%%
%% The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI,
%% or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary
%% service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called
%% `AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents'. For more information, see AWS
%% service-linked role.

%% @doc Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch.
%%
%% CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the
%% specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When
%% CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the
%% metric to appear in calls to ListMetrics.
%%
%% You can publish either individual data points in the `Value' field, or
%% arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the
%% period by using the `Values' and `Counts' fields in the `MetricDatum'
%% structure. Using the `Values' and `Counts' method enables you to publish
%% up to 150 values per metric with one `PutMetricData' request, and supports
%% retrieving percentile statistics on this data.
%%
%% Each `PutMetricData' request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST
%% requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also
%% limited to no more than 20 different metrics.
%%
%% Although the `Value' parameter accepts numbers of type `Double',
%% CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values
%% must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for
%% example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
%%
%% You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data
%% the metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For
%% more information about specifying dimensions, see Publishing Metrics in
%% the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
%%
%% You specify the time stamp to be associated with each data point. You can
%% specify time stamps that are as much as two weeks before the current date,
%% and as much as 2 hours after the current day and time.
%%
%% Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least
%% 48 hours to become available for GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics from
%% the time they are submitted. Data points with time stamps between 3 and 24
%% hours ago can take as much as 2 hours to become available for for
%% GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics.
%%
%% CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If
%% you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve
%% percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is
%% true:
%%
%% <ul> <li> The `SampleCount' value of the statistic set is 1 and `Min',
%% `Max', and `Sum' are all equal.
%%
%% </li> <li> The `Min' and `Max' are equal, and `Sum' is equal to `Min'
%% multiplied by `SampleCount'.
%%
%% </li> </ul>

%% @doc Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes.
%%
%% When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action
%% configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your
%% alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is
%% triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to `ALARM' sends an SNS
%% message.
%%
%% Metric alarms returns to their actual state quickly, often within seconds.
%% Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically
%% only visible in the alarm's History tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console
%% or through DescribeAlarmHistory.
%%
%% If you use `SetAlarmState' on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is
%% not guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual
%% state only once any of its children alarms change state. It is also
%% reevaluated if you update its configuration.
%%
%% If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling
%% policies, you must include information in the `StateReasonData' parameter
%% to enable the policy to take the correct action.

%% @doc Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified
%% CloudWatch resource.
%%
%% Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that can be tagged are alarms and
%% Contributor Insights rules.
%%
%% Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use
%% them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or
%% change only resources with certain tag values.
%%
%% Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly
%% as strings of characters.
%%
%% You can use the `TagResource' action with an alarm that already has tags.
%% If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the
%% list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is
%% already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify
%% replaces the previous value for that tag.
%%
%% You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.
