:rocket: Create, configure, and manage AWS services from Erlang code. :rocket:

## Features

* A clean API separated per service. One module per service.
* Support for most of the AWS services.
* Generated by [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) using the
  same JSON descriptions of AWS services used to build the
  [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis).
* Documentation updated from the official AWS docs.

## Usage

Here is an example of listing Amazon Kinesis streams. First of all,
start a shell with `rebar3 shell`, then:
### aws_s3

Here is another example, this time using a _temporary_ client, showing
how to upload a file to _S3_ and how to fetch it back:

```erlang
> Client = aws_client:make_temporary_client(<<"my-access-key-id">>, <<"my-secret-access-key">>, <<"my-token">>, <<"eu-west-1">>).
[...]
> {ok, Content} = file:read_file("/tmp/erlang-logo.png").
[...]
> aws_s3:put_object(Client, <<"my-bucket">>, <<"my-key">>, #{<<"Body">> => Content}).
[...]
> {ok, Response, _} = aws_s3:get_object(Client, <<"my-bucket">>, <<"my-key">>).
[...]
> Content = maps:get(<<"Body">>, Response).
```

Support for creating [Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) is provided
through the `aws_s3_presigned_url` module.

### aws_kinesis

```erlang
> Client = aws_client:make_client(<<"my-access-key-id">>, <<"my-secret-access-key">>, <<"eu-west-1">>),
[...]
> {ok, Result, _Response} = aws_kinesis:list_streams(Client, #{}),
[...]
> io:format("~p~n", [Result]).
#{<<"HasMoreStreams">> => false,<<"StreamNames">> => []}
```

### retry options

Each API which takes `Options` allows a `retry_options` key and can allow for automatic retries.
Simple provide the following:

`[{retry_options, {exponential_with_jitter, {MaxAttempts, BaseSleepTime, CapSleepTime}}} | <other_options>]`

This implementation is based on [AWS: Exponential Backoff And Jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/).

## Installation

Simply add the library to your `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{deps, [{aws, "1.0.0", {pkg, aws_erlang}}]}.
```

## Obtaining Credentials

Credentials can be obtained via the separate [aws_credentials](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws_credentials) application, which can be configured to fetch credentials from:

* Erlang environment variables
* OS environment variables
* An AWS credentials file
* ECS task credentials
* EC2 metadata (including v2 - IMDS)

Here is an example on how to obtain credentials:

```erlang
> Credentials = aws_credentials:get_credentials().
[...]
> #{ access_key_id := AccessKeyId
   , token := Token
   , region := Region
   , secret_access_key := SecretAccessKey } = Credentials.
```

The `aws_credentials` application can be installed by adding the following to your `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{deps, [{aws_credentials, "0.1.10"}]}.
```

## Development

The service-specific modules are generated using the [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) library from the JSON descriptions of AWS services provided by Amazon.

The rest of the code is manually written and used as support for the generated code.

## Documentation

### Check it Online

* [Hex Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/aws_erlang/)

### Build it locally

```bash
$ rebar3 ex_doc
```

The docs will be available in `./doc`.

## Running Tests

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

```bash
$ docker-compose -f test/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
$ rebar3 ct
$ docker-compose -f test/docker/docker-compose.yml down
```
